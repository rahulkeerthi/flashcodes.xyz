Flashcodes is a gamified, social quiz app to help you learn and remember coding theory and syntax. The gamification aspect is implemented through a levelling-up system where groups of up to 10 users aim to earn points via completing quizzes to progress their group from a village to a town to a city to a planet. Groups are language-specific and are joined when a user starts that language for the first time. When a group is full, a new one is created and users can track their progress across different groups/worlds via their profiles.

You can see the application's core user journeys as presented during London 360 + 361's [demo day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Pvj2iJ6po). The presention is done by myself (Rahul), supported by team-mate Shane W. Also on our team are Tomas K and Max JV.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), during the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) in London (Batch 361).
